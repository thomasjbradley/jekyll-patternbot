## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added support for pretty permalinks.
- Added internal pattern post processors to remove patterns when they aren’t included in the user’s code.

### Changed

- Changed the default folder location for sample pages to have a hyphen instead of underscore.
- Patterns aren’t required to be listed in `config.patterns` any more, having just the `.html` file is enough.
- Renamed `FileHelpers` & `JekyllHelpers` to be not plural for consistency.
- Changed all my very un-Ruby `if not` statements into `unless` statements.

### Fixed

- Errors are now thrown, coloured, when Patternbot can’t find specific files.
